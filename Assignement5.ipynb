        "*   Ans.15: Python uses a hybrid approach to garbage collection: reference counting and generational garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Ans.16: The else block allows you to execute specific code when the try block's operations are successful and no errors occur.\n",

        "\n",
