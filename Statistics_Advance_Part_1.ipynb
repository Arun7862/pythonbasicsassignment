        "\n",
        "Ans:-8-  The binomial distribution is a probability distribution that models the probability of a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure) and a constant probability of success like toss coin.\n",

        "Ans:-13-  The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample means will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the original population distribution.

        "Ans:-17-  In statistics, point estimates offer a single value as the best guess for a population parameter, while interval estimates provide a range of values that are likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-21-  The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) has a few key assumptions to ensure its validity in practical applications. Primarily, the samples should be drawn independently and randomly from the population, and the sample size needs to be sufficiently large.\n",

        "Ans:-23-  A probability distribution describes how probabilities are allocated to the possible values of a random variable.
